# VSCode-Weather-Extension

Sick of losing valuable time coding to go outside to check the weather? Do you die a little inside when you leave the basement only to 
find out it's raining? Now you can get the cloudcover and temperature of your zip code without having to leave the comfort of your computer chair!
This extension takes your zipcode as an input and provides the current cloud cover and temperature(freedom units) in the bottom left corner
of the status bar! There are even cool icons to go with it.


Using it is simple:

cntl + shift + p and choose the get-weather package
